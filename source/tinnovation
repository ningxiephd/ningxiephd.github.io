== AI literacy

Introducing students to the latest AI guidelines, tools, ethical use principles, hands-on applications. 
Sample classroom activity: An AI-assisted hiring committee decision making exercise 

Augmented reality, virtual reality, and 360 degree videos
The future of the advertising industry will grow out of the two dimensional boundaries, and I want students to develop vision for future-oriented practices. I arranged for students to try on virtual reality devices, experience augmented reality demonstrations, and design a prototype of immersive advertisements.  
Students viewed immersive advertisements for Lipton, Oreos, Adidas, Redbull, F1 racecar.

== Gamification

The future of the advertising industry will also feature gamification. I arranged for students to learn about gamification applications including

- Nintendo 64, GameCube, Wii U, Switch
- Sony PlayStation 
- Sega Saturn, Dreamcast
- Microsoft Xbox 360 
- 3D printing


== Industry-standard skills

I am intentional about setting learning objectives and designing curriculum that directly translates into industry-standard, job-ready skills.
E.g. data visualization software such as Flourish, Tableau
User experience research


== Career preparedness

I want the best for my students. I work students to identify their unique strengths, nurture their personal brand, build a project for their portfolio, and prepare for career and/or further education after graduation. Some themes I teach include:

- Psychometric assessment
- Networking and mentorship
- Career development
- Entrepreneurship
- Actively sharing opportunities for internships, jobs, scholarship, opportunities for personal growth

From the bottom of my heart, I truly want to see each student do what they love, lead a life that fulfills their mission, and thrive.
