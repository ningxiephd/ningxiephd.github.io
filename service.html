<h3>Fundraising:</h3>
<p>My work in leadership of caring for others and raising funds was covered by national and local media.
I organized a fundraising event for my middle school math teacher. Four years after our graduation from middle school, our middle school math teacher, Yuexiao He, was diagnosed with leukemia. I organized 40+ classmates to honor and to care for our teacher. We raised money, hosted an honorary luncheon gathering, and conducted a class visit to our alma mater. Our efforts contributed to attracting coverage from national and local media, which led to more donations and honors for our teacher.
